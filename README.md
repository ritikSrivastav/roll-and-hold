📌 About the Game

Roll & Hold is a simple two-player dice game where players take turns rolling a die. The goal is to reach 100 points first without rolling a 1, which resets the turn's score!

If you roll a 6, you get a bonus.

If you roll a 1, you lose your turn!

Winning Condition 🏆 – The first player to reach 100 points wins!
